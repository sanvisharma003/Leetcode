Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If s[j] >= g[i], we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Example 1:
Input: g = [1,2,3], s = [1,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 children are 1, 2, 3. And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only make the child whose greed factor is 1 content. You need to output 1.

CODE:

class Solution 
{
    public int findContentChildren(int[] g, int[] s) 
    {
        if(s.length==0 || g.length==0)
          return 0;

        Arrays.sort(g);
        Arrays.sort(s);

        int ans=0;
        int i=0,j=0;
        
        while(i<g.length && j<s.length)
        {
          if(g[i]<=s[j])
          {
            ans++;
            i++;
          }
          j++;
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
