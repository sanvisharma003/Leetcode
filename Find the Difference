You are given two strings s and t. String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position. Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

CODE:

class Solution 
{
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) 
    {
        if(t.length()>s.length())
            s=s+" ";
        
        char result='r';
        char[] x=s.toCharArray();
        char[] y=t.toCharArray();

        Arrays.sort(x);
        Arrays.sort(y);

        for(int i=0;i<t.length();i++)
        {
            if(x[i]!=y[i])
              result=y[i];
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
