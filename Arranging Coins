You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete. Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

Example 1:
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.

CODE:

class Solution 
{
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) 
    {
      int i=1, st=0;

      while(n>0)
      {
        n=n-i;

        if(n>=0)
          st++;

        i++;
      }  

      return st;
    }
}
