You are given an integer array nums, an integer k, and an integer multiplier. You need to perform k operations on nums. In each operation: Find the minimum value x in nums. If there are multiple occurrences of the minimum value, select the one that appears first. Replace the selected minimum value x with x * multiplier. Return an integer array denoting the final state of nums after performing all k operations.
 
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,1,3,5,6], k = 5, multiplier = 2
Output: [8,4,6,5,6]
Explanation:
Operation	Result
After operation 1	[2, 2, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 2	[4, 2, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 3	[4, 4, 3, 5, 6]
After operation 4	[4, 4, 6, 5, 6]
After operation 5	[8, 4, 6, 5, 6]

CODE : 

class Solution 
{
    public int[] getFinalState(int[] nums, int k, int multiplier) 
    {
        while(k>0)
        {
            int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE, ind=0;
            for(int i=0; i<nums.length; i++)
            {
                if(nums[i]<min)
                {
                    min=nums[i];
                    ind=i;
                }
            }
            nums[ind]=nums[ind]*multiplier;
            k--;
        }
        return nums;
    }
}
