There are n cities. Some of them are connected, while some are not. If city a is connected directly with city b, and city b is connected directly with city c, then city a is connected indirectly with city c. A province is a group of directly or indirectly connected cities and no other cities outside of the group. You are given an n x n matrix isConnected where isConnected[i][j] = 1 if the ith city and the jth city are directly connected, and isConnected[i][j] = 0 otherwise. Return the total number of provinces.

Example 1:
Input: isConnected = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2

CODE:

class Solution 
{
    public int findCircleNum(int[][] arr) 
    {
      int cnt=0;
      int[]vis= new int[arr.length];

      for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++)
      {
          if(vis[i]==0 )
          {
            procal(arr,vis,i);
            cnt++;
          }
        }
        
      return cnt;
    }

    void procal(int[][]arr, int[]vis, int i)
    {
      vis[i]=1;

      for(int j=0;j<arr.length;j++)
      {
        if(arr[i][j]==1 && vis[j]==0)
          procal(arr,vis,j);
      }
    }
}
