Given two non-negative integers low and high. Return the count of odd numbers between low and high (inclusive).

Example 1:
Input: low = 3, high = 7
Output: 3
Explanation: The odd numbers between 3 and 7 are [3,5,7].

CODE 1:

class Solution 
{
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) 
    {
        return ((high+1)/2) - (low/2);
    }
}

CODE 2:

class Solution 
{
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) 
    {
        int ans=0;

        for(int i=low; i<=high; i++)
        {
            if(i%2!=0)
                ans++;
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
