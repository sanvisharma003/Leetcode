The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different. Given two integers x and y, return the Hamming distance between them.

Example 1:
Input: x = 1, y = 4
Output: 2
Explanation:
1   (0 0 0 1)
4   (0 1 0 0)

The above arrows point to positions where the corresponding bits are different.

CODE:

class Solution 
{
    public int hammingDistance(int x, int y) 
    {
      int ans=0;

      while(x>0 || y>0)
      {
        if(x%2!=y%2)
          ans++;

        x=x/2;
        y=y/2;
      }

      return ans;
    }
}
