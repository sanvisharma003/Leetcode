You're given strings jewels representing the types of stones that are jewels, and stones representing the stones you have. Each character in stones is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:
Input: jewels = "aA", stones = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3

CODE:

class Solution 
{
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) 
    {
      HashMap<Character,Integer>map=new HashMap<>();
      int i=0,j=0,count=0;

      while(i< jewels.length())
      {
        map.put(jewels.charAt(i),1);
        i++;
      }

      while(j< stones.length())
      {
        if(map.containsKey(stones.charAt(j)))
          count++;
        j++;
      }
      return count;
    }
}
